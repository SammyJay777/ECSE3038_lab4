# ECSE3038 LAB 4
This is the fourth lab issued in ECSE3038 on February 19, 2021

## Purpose 
This laboratory exercise was created to help students of the ECSE3038, Engineering Iot class, become familiar with REST ApiS and using the PostgreSQL database hosting service ElephantSQL. The Flask-SQLAlchemy, psycopg2-binary and SQLAlchemy frameworks were used to name a few. The api was tested with Postman. marshmallow-sqlalchemy was used in order to add a layer of security to the system.
